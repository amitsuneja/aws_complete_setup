If you want to list all the files currently being tracked under the branch master, you could use this command:
git ls-tree -r master --name-only

If you want a list of files that ever existed (i.e. including deleted files):
git log --pretty=format: --name-only --diff-filter=A | sort - | sed '/^$/d'
